We all know that crontab is shitty and while it's stable enough it's too limited so I decided to create Gronos (previously Goronos).
In addition to the scheduler engine I plan to add a UI for easier use.  

The idea is for it to start off of on some predefined YAML formatted schedules and then be able to edit or add or remove schedules later on.
